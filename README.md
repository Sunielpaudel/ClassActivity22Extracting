# Name Extraction Project

This project is a simple C++ program designed to extract and display the first name and last name from a full name string. It utilizes basic string manipulation techniques and demonstrates the use of namespaces and modular programming in C++.

## Objectives
- *Understand C++ Basics*: Learn fundamental concepts of C++ including namespaces, functions, and standard libraries.
- *String Manipulation*: Gain experience in manipulating strings using the std::string class, specifically the substr method to extract parts of a string.
- *Modular Programming*: Implement a structured approach by separating declarations and definitions using header files and source files.
- *Input and Output*: Practice using standard input and output streams to communicate information to the user.

### Files:
1. **headerName.hpp**: 
   - This is the header file that contains the function declaration of the `naming` function inside the `Naming` namespace.

2. **main.cpp**:
   - This is the main entry point of the program. It calls the `naming` function from the `Naming` namespace.

3. **naming.cpp**:
   - This file contains the implementation of the `naming` function, where:
     - The full name is hardcoded as `"John Doe"`.
     - The program extracts the first name and last name using `std::substr` and displays them.
